Here are some things to do before class:

- [Update R](https://www.r-project.org/) to the most recent version (v. 4.3.2; *Eye Holes*)
- [Update RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to the most recent version (v. 2023.12.0+369)
- Update all of your R packages (In the `Packages` tab in RStudio click `Update`)
- Update the `{educate}` package (to at least v.0.3.0.1). This is a github package, so see the instructions in [Installing Packages from GitHub](https://zief0002.github.io/toolkit-quarto/03-getting-started-with-r.html)
