Refresh your knowledge about probability distributions, by completing the following prior to class:

- Read **Section 3.1.1:** (*Probability Basics*) and Sections 3.3.1--3.3.4: (*Continuous Distributions*) in [@Fox:2009]. 
- You might also find the [Kahn Academy: Random Variables and Probability Distributions](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/random-variables-topic) tutorial helpful.
