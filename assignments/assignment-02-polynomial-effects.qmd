In this assignment, you will use the data from the file *fertility.csv* to explain variation in in infant mortality rates. 

- [[CSV]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/fluffy-ants/main/data/fertility.csv)
- [[Data Codebook]](http://zief0002.github.io/fluffy-ants/codebooks/fertility.html)

## Instructions

**Quarto Submissions**

Create a project directory called "assignment-02". Within this directory, create a QMD document (this can be a QMD, or word-processed documents) to respond to each of the questions below. All code chunks should include a label `#| label:` and include comments. Submit a zipped version of your entire `assignment-02` project directory.


**Non-Quarto Submissions**

Submit both the word-processed documents that respond to each of the questions below, as well as a commented, organized script file.


For all submissions your syntax will be evaluated based on the rubric at the end of the assignment. This will count for *2pts.** of the assignment score and will be scored as follows:

- 2pts: Most/All of the evaluation  is "Always" AND you have no categories marked as "Rarely" or "Never"
- 1.5pts: Most/All of the evaluation is "Most of the time" AND you have no categories marked as "Rarely" or "Never"
- 1pt: Most/All of the evaluation is "Sometimes" OR you have one category marked as "Rarely" marks AND no "Never" marks
- 0.5pts: Most/All of the evaluation is "Sometimes" or you have more than one categories marked as "Rarely" and no categories marked as "Never"
- 0pts: You have one or more categories marked as "Never"

## Model 1: Linear Effect of Female Education Level

1. Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between female education level and infant mortality rates.  Does this plot suggest problems about meeting the assumption of linearity? Explain.


2. Regress infant mortality rates on female education level. For this model, posit a linear effect of female education level on infant mortality rate (Model 1). Create the scatterplot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values from Model 1.

3. Does this plot suggest problems about meeting the assumption that the average residual is zero at each fitted value? Explain.

<br />


## Model 2: Quadratic Effect of Female Education Level

4. Regress infant mortality rates on female education level. For this model, posit a quadratic effect of female education level on infant mortality rate (Model 2). Write the *fitted equation* using Equation Editor (or some other program that correctly types mathematical expressions).

5. Compute, report, and interpret the likelihood ratio between Model 2 and Model 1.

6. Carry out a likelihood ratio test to compare Model 1 and Model 2. Report the results from this test in a nicely formatted table.


<br />


## Model 3: Control for Differences in Gross National Income (GNI)

7.  Regress infant mortality rates on female education level. For this model, posit a quadratic effect of female education level on infant mortality rate, and also control for differences in Gross National Income (Model 3). (Use all four levels of GNI.) Write the *fitted equation* using Equation Editor (or some other program that correctly types mathematical expressions).

8. Carry out a likelihood ratio test to compare Model 2 and Model 3. Add the results from this test to the table you created in Question \#6.

<br />


## Adopting a Model

9. Based on the results of the two likelihood ratio tests, which model will you adopt? Explain.

10. Create the density plot of the marginal distribution of the standardized residuals for your adopted model, as well as the scatterplot of the standardized residuals versus the fitted values. Place these plots side-by-side in your printed document and, for the purposes of captioning, etc. treat them as two subfigures within a single figure.

11. Based on the plots you created in Question 10, evaluate and comment on the tenability of each of the model assumptions. 
<br />


## Presenting the Results

12.  Mimic the format and structure of either of the first two tables in the *Presenting Results from Many Fitted Regression Models* section of the document [Creating Tables to Present Statistical Results](https://zief0002.github.io/musings/creating-tables-to-present-statistical-results.html) to create a table to present the numerical information from the three models you fitted in this assignment. Make sure the table you create also has an appropriate caption. If the table is too wide, change the page orientation in your word processing program to "Landscape", rather than changing the size of the font. (Note: Only this table should be presented in landscape orientation...not your entire assignment!)

13. Create a publication quality plot that displays the fitted curves from Model 3. Display four separate lines to show the effect of Gross National Income. The four lines should be displayed using different linetypes or colors (or both) so that they can be easily differentiated in the plot.

# Rubric for Evaluating Student Syntax

**Documentation:** Is the syntax well annotated to aid communication to other educational scientists and researchers? Each of these are scored "Always", "Most of the time", "Sometimes", "Rarely", "Never" 

- Labels (in QMD) should be descriptive of the syntax in the chunk or more holistic comments should be included (in .R files) to explain chunks of syntax
- Comments are liberally included to explain smaller pieces of syntax (especially where non-common code is used).
- Object names accurately describe the intent of the object (e.g., `pew_data` rather than `d`)
- Plots should include a comment that provides the caption (or usage of `fig-cap:` in QMD)


**Structure and Presentation:** Is the syntax organized and structured to be "readable" and easy to follow for other educational scientists and researchers? Each of these are scored "Always", "Most of the time", "Sometimes", "Rarely", "Never"

- Consistent use of case (e.g., lower-case, camel-case) for all objects
- Consistent use of operators throughout the code (e.g., always using `<-` or `=` for assignment)
- Spacing is included for readability (e.g., `lm.1 = lm(...)` rather than `lm.1=lm(...)`)
- Indentation and line breaks are included in long code (e.g., when using `|>` or when a function has many arguments), especially in `{dplyr}` and `{ggplot}` syntax
