In this assignment, you will use the data from the file *wine.csv* to examine several different predictors of wine rating (a measure of the wine's quality). The literature has suggested that price of wine is quite predictive of a wine's quality.

## Instructions

**Quarto Submissions**

Create a project directory called "assignment-02". Within this directory, create a QMD document (this can be a QMD, or word-processed documents) to respond to each of the questions below. All code chunks should include a label `#| label:` and include comments. Submit a zipped version of your entire `assignment-02` project directory.


**Non-Quarto Submissions**

Submit both the word-processed documents that respond to each of the questions below, as well as a commented, organized script file.


For all submissions your syntax will be evaluated based on the rubric at the end of the assignment. This will count for *2pts.** of the assignment score and will be scored as follows:

- 2pts: Most/All of the evaluation  is "Always" AND you have no categories marked as "Rarely" or "Never"
- 1.5pts: Most/All of the evaluation is "Most of the time" AND you have no categories marked as "Rarely" or "Never"
- 1pt: Most/All of the evaluation is "Sometimes" OR you have one category marked as "Rarely" marks AND no "Never" marks
- 0.5pts: Most/All of the evaluation is "Sometimes" or you have more than one categories marked as "Rarely" and no categories marked as "Never"
- 0pts: You have one or more categories marked as "Never"

## Model 1: Effect of Wine Rating on Price

1. Create and examine the scatterplot of the relationship between wine rating (predictor) and price. Include the loess smoother in this plot. Does this plot suggest any nonlinearity in the relationship between wine rating and price that we need to address?

2. Regress the log-transformed price variable (using the natural logarithm) on wine rating (Model 1). Report and interpret the slope coefficient (using the log-metric) from the fitted model.

3. Report and interpret the back-transformed slope coefficient from Model 1.

<br />


## Effect of Wine Rating and Region on Log-Transformed Price

Fit two additional models:

- A model that includes the effects of whether or not the wine is from California (i.e., `california`) to predict variation in the log-transformed price  (**Model 2**). 
- A model that includes the effects of wine rating *and* whether or not the wine is from California (i.e., `california`) to predict variation in the log-transformed price  (**Model 3**). 


4. Interpret the effect associated with `california` predictor (using the log-metric) from Model 3.

5. Report and interpret the back-transformed coefficient associated with `california` predictor from Model 3.


Fit a model that includes both the wine rating and `california` main effects, as well as, the interaction effect between those predictors to predict variation in the log-transformed price (**Model 4**). 

6.  Create a table to present the numerical information from the four models you fitted in this assignment along with the AICc values. (Mimic the *Presenting Results from Many Fitted Regression Models* section of the document [Creating Tables to Present Statistical Results](https://zief0002.github.io/musings/creating-tables-to-present-statistical-results.html) to create this table. Include the AICc value below the RMSE value in the table.)  Make sure the table you create also has an appropriate caption. If the table is too wide, change the page orientation in your word processing program to "Landscape", rather than changing the size of the font. (Note: Only this table should be presented in landscape orientation...not your entire assignment!) **(2pts.)**


<br />


## Adopting a "Final" Candidate Model(s)

7. Write the fitted equation for any adopted candidate models.

8. Create and report a set of residual plots that allow you to evaluate any adopted model's assumptions. Are the assumptions for the model satisfied? Explain. **(2pts.)**

<br />


## Presenting the Results

9. Create a publication quality plot that displays the fitted curve(s) from your adopted candidate model. If you show more than one curve, each line should be easily differentiated in the plot. (Note: Make sure that you back-transform any log-transformed variables when you create this plot.) **(2pts.)**

10. Use the plot to help describe/interpret the effect of wine rating on price.

# Rubric for Evaluating Student Syntax

**Documentation:** Is the syntax well annotated to aid communication to other educational scientists and researchers? Each of these are scored "Always", "Most of the time", "Sometimes", "Rarely", "Never" 

- Labels (in QMD) should be descriptive of the syntax in the chunk or more holistic comments should be included (in .R files) to explain chunks of syntax
- Comments are liberally included to explain smaller pieces of syntax (especially where non-common code is used).
- Object names accurately describe the intent of the object (e.g., `pew_data` rather than `d`)
- Plots should include a comment that provides the caption (or usage of `fig-cap:` in QMD)


**Structure and Presentation:** Is the syntax organized and structured to be "readable" and easy to follow for other educational scientists and researchers? Each of these are scored "Always", "Most of the time", "Sometimes", "Rarely", "Never"

- Consistent use of case (e.g., lower-case, camel-case) for all objects
- Consistent use of operators throughout the code (e.g., always using `<-` or `=` for assignment)
- Spacing is included for readability (e.g., `lm.1 = lm(...)` rather than `lm.1=lm(...)`)
- Indentation and line breaks are included in long code (e.g., when using `|>` or when a function has many arguments), especially in `{dplyr}` and `{ggplot}` syntax
